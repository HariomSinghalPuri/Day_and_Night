## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- No server required â€“ runs as a static webpage

---
## âœ¨Project Structure

```bash
/project-root
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Main HTML structure with embedded SVG scenes
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css         # Styling for layout and fullscreen toggle
â””â”€â”€ main.js           # GSAP scroll animations and logic

```


## ðŸ§ª Usage
- Open index.html in a browser.
- Scroll down to trigger animation sequences.
- Click the "Go Fullscreen" button to view in full-screen mode.

### The animations include:
- Parallax scrolling of hills (#h1-*, #h2-*, #h3-*)
- Sun movement and color transitions
- Flying birds and appearing bats
- Clouds drifting across the screen
- Transition to night scene with stars and a falling star

#  

## Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HariomSinghalPuri/Day_and_Night.git
```

# 

### Future Improvements
- Add interactive sound effects (bird chirps, night ambience, etc.)
- Optimize performance for low-powered devices
- Implement navigation controls for manual scene transitions
- Support touch gesture animations for mobile
- Add additional story elements or educational content during the scroll
