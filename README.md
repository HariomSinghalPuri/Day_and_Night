- __Animated Nature Scenes__: Transition from day to night with dynamic sun movement, clouds, birds, bats, and a falling star.

- __Scroll-Triggered Animations__: All elements animate based on scroll position using GSAP's ScrollTrigger.

- __Fullscreen Mode__: Immerse yourself by toggling fullscreen.

- __Responsive & Clean UI__: Minimalist design with hidden scrollbars for a distraction-free experience.

   - Transitions scenes from day to night.
   - Handles fullscreen toggle.

## 🎨 Customization

- __Add Layers__: Insert more SVG elements for extra parallax depth.
